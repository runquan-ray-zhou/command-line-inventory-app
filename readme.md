# Command-Line-Inventory-App

## Description

- I am building a fully functional inventory app that includes both front and back end functionality, and this command-line-inventory-app is a dry run of what kind of user interaction and functionality the react app will need. 
- I am building the react inventory app to help users that need better control of their inventory in a freezer warehouse.
- There are many inventory control programs and app out there.  My version is just another option out there for businesses.
- For the command-line-inventory-app, I learn to write functions and console log the response based on the user input.  This is very important when I build the back end to my React Inventory App
